To get the same look as in the screenshots in the asset store, please use unitys post processing stack v2- download it via the package manager, place the layer effect on your camera and create a global volume where you insert the PostProcessingProfile that comes with this pack. For best visual results, you might want to bake the scene (pretty low settings are sufficient, since the scene is pretty big).

Post processing stack and documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.postprocessing@3.0/manual/index.html

Sorry for the inconvenience, but in the asset store, model packs aren't allowed to include any standard assets or effects.

Thanks a lot for the purchase, I hope this is useful to you!
